## Question 1 
Design a program that asks users to input their name and print"Hello, name!"
## Answer 1 
    x=input("Please input your name:")   
    print("Hello, %s"%x)  
    print("Hello, {}".format(x))   

## Question 2 
Design a program that asks users to input numbers between 1 to 100, and print "Good choice" if they did so, otherwise print "Please think for a while"
## Answer 2 
    number1=int(input("Please input a number between 1 and 100:"))   
    if 1<=number1<=100:  

        print("Good choice")    
    else: 

        print("Please think for a while")  

## Question 3 
Design a program: randomize an integer from 1 to 10, and let users guess what it is. If users' guess is right, print "Good Luck You!", otherwise print "Oh sorry it's too large/small!", then let users input again and remind users "you have n chances left!". Maximum 3 chances.
## Answer 3
    import random   
    temp1 = random.randint(1,10)   
    temp2 = int(input("Please input an integer between 1 and 10, you have 3 chances:"))     
    i=3     
    while i:   
        if temp1==temp2:  
            print("Good Luck You!")   
            i=0   
        else:   
            if temp2 > temp1:   
                print("Oh sorry it's too large!")   
            else:   
                print("Oh sorry it's too small!")   
            if i-1>0:   
                temp2 = int(input("Please input an integer between 1 and 10, you have %d chances left:"%(i-1)))   
                i-=1   
            else:   
                print("No chances left!")   
                i=0   
    print('Game Over')   

## Question 4
Let users input an positive integer and list all the positive integers less than or equal to this one. Each listed integer is in one line.
## Answer 4:
    temp = int(input("Please input an positive integer:"))    
    i=1    
    while temp:
        print(i)    
        i+=1   
        temp-=1   
    
## Question 5
Let users input a positive integer and draw a picture as following:(for example users input 5)
         
        *****   
       ****   
      ***   
     **   
    *   
## Answer 5

    temp = int(input("Please input a positive integer:"))   
    while temp:   

        print(" " * (temp-1) + '*'* temp)   
        temp-=1   
## A more complicated version of Answer 5:
    temp = input("Please input a positive integer:")   
    number = int(temp)   
    while number:   

        i = number - 1   
        while i:</br>
            print(' ', end = '')   
            i = i - 1   
        j = number   
        while j:   
            print('*', end = '')   
            j = j - 1   
        print()   
        number = number - 1

## Question 6
Design a program to judge whether a particular year is a leap year.
## Anaswer 6
    Judge = 'Y'    
    while (Judge=='Y') or (Judge=='y'):   
        temp = input("Please input year:")   
        while not temp.isdigit():   
            temp = input("Sorry! Incorrect input. Please input an integer:")   
        year=int(temp)   
        if year/400 == int(year/400):   
            print(temp + " is a leap year!")   
        else:   
            if year/4 == int(year/4):   
                print(temp + " is a leap year!")   
            else:   
                print(temp + " is NOT a leap year!")   
        Judge = input("Go on or not? Y/N:")   

    print("User has terminated the program.")   

## Question 7
There is a long ladder, if you take 2 steps each time, and finally 1 step left;If once take 3 steps, you end up with 2 steps ;If 5 steps each time, 4 steps left.If 6 steps a time, you end up with 5 steps left. If you take 7 steps each time, you finish climbing with no steps left. How many steps does the ladder have?
## Answer 7
    i=1
    while not ((i%2==1) and (i%3==2) and (i%5==4) and (i%6==5) and (i%7==0)):
        i+=1
    print(i)
## Question 8
What does "if not (i<100)" meanï¼Ÿ
## Answer 8
It means:  
      if i>=100  
## Question 9
x=1, y=2, z=3. How to exchange values of x, y, z?
## Answer 9
For example: x, y, z= z, x, y
# 19/01/2019
## Question 10
In the final example of Baruch College, if your score is between 90 and 100: you get A; between 80 and 90: you get B; between 60 and 80, you get C;  below 60, you get F. According to statistical law, grades is normally distributed, so most students get 60-80. Design an effective program to relize: when you input your score, you get A, B, C, or F printed out.   
## Answer 10
    Score=float(input("Please input your score:"))
    if 60<=Score<80:
        print("C")
    elif 90<=Score<=100:
        print("A")
    elif 80<=Score<90:
        print("B")
    elif 0<=Score<60:
        print("F")
    else:
        print("Illegal Input!")

## Question 11
Rewrite the following codes to make it more efficient.(Using Ternary operators).

    x, y, z = 6, 5, 4    
    if x < y:    
        small = x
    if z < small:
        small = z
    elif y < z:
        small = y
    else:
        small = z
## Answer 11
    small=x if(x<y and x<z) else (y if y<z else z)
## Question 12
How many times will "Github" be printed in each of the following situation?
(1)    

    for i in range(0, 10, 2):  
        print('Github')
(2)    

    for i in 5:
        print('Github')    
## Answer 12
(1) 5 "Github"s will be printed, because we start from 0, and grow by 2, so we have: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and stop at 10.
(2) Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\domain-master\practices\hello.py", line 1, in <module>
    for i in 5:
TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
## Question 13
(1) What will range(10) generate?    
(2) What will the following codes print?
     
     while True:
        while True:
            break
            print(1)
        print(2)
        break
    print(3)
## Answer 13
(1) If you type range(10) in python IDLE, it will generate range(0,10), and if you list(rang(0,10)), you will get: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. However, it does not include 10.    
(2) 2 3 will be printed. Because after break in the inside "while" loop, print(1) will not be executed.    
## Question 14
How to make the following codes more efficient?  
    
    i = 0
    string = 'Github'
    while i < len(string):
        print(i)
        i += 1
## Answer 14
    i=0
    string = 'Github'
    length = len('Github')
    while i < length:
        print(i)
        i += 1
## Question 15
Please design a program that can realize the following:
"Please input your password:******   
 Don't input "*", you have 3 times left!Please input your password: ***IloveYou   
 Don't input "\*", you have 3 times left!Please input your password: okokok   
Incorrerct password!! You have 2 times left!Please input your password: okfine   
Incorrerct password!! You have 1 times left!Please input your password: github   
Correct. The program is starting...   
## Answer 15
    temp=input('Please input your password:')
    password="github"
    i=3
    while "*" in temp:
        print('Don\'t input "*", you have %d times left!'%i,end="")
        temp=input('Please input your password:')
    while (temp!=password) and (i>0):
        i-=1
        print("Incorrerct password!! You have %i times left!"%i, end="")
        temp=input('Please input your password:')
    print("Correct. The program is starting...")
## Question 16
An n-digit number that is the sum of the nth powers of its digits is called an n-narcissistic number. It is also sometimes known as an Armstrong number, perfect digital invariant (Madachy 1979), or plus perfect number. Hardy (1993) wrote, "There are just four numbers, after unity, which are the sums of the cubes of their digits: 153=1^3+5^3+3^3,  370=3^3+7^3+0^3, 371=3^3+7^3+1^3, and 407=4^3+0^3+7^3. These are odd facts, very suitable for puzzle columns and likely to amuse amateurs, but there is nothing in them which appeals to the mathematician." Narcissistic numbers therefore generalize these "unappealing" numbers to other powers (Madachy 1979, p. 164).
The smallest example of a narcissistic number other than the trivial 1-digit numbers is    
 153=1^3+5^3+3^3.     
 Design a program to find out all 3-narcissistic number from 100-999.
 ## Answer 16
 Method 1   
     
     for a in range(1,10,1):
        A=100*a
        for b in range(0,10,1):
            B=10*b
            for c in range(0,10,1):
                C=c
                i=A+B+C
                while i==a**3+b**3+c**3:
                    print(i)
                    break    
Method 2   

    for i in range(100, 1000):
        sum = 0
        temp = i
        while temp:
            sum = sum + (temp%10) ** 3
            temp //= 10        
        if sum == i:
            print(i)
    
Method 3   A general way to find out narcissistic numbers:
   
        def narcissistic_number_1(num):

        length = len(str(num))

        count = length    

        num_sum = 0    

        while count:        

            num_sum += ((num // 10 ** (count - 1)) % 10) ** length     

            count -= 1    

        else:       

            if num_sum == num:            

                print("%d is %d bit narcissistic_number" % (num, length))
            else:                        
                pass


    max_num = int(input('Please input your range:'))


    for num in range(0, max_num):

        narcissistic_number_1(num)
